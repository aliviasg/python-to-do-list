<h1 align="center"> TO-DO LIST </h1>

<p>This project was developed for a university discipline with the objective of developing an algorithm that would help in some everyday activity.

I'm an organized person, so I thought a to-do list would be very helpful. It was made 100% in <b>Python</b>.</p>

## :hammer: Functions
- `1st function`: "Adicionar tarefa" is an <i>add task</i> button.
- `2nd function`: "Deletar tarefa" is a <i>delete task</i> button.
- `3rd function`: "Salvar lista" is a <i>save list</i> button.
- `4th function`: "Carregar lista" is a <i>load list</i> button.

:construction: Finished :construction:
<p>And I guess this is it.ðŸ˜Š</p>
